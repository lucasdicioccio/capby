* return if sending was successful or not
* when sending ary of packets, find a way to block when there's an error/raise
* double check that the blocking/unblocking mode both work fine
* verify the case where we break from the each loop (with ensure)
* type checks before doing pointer magic (i.e., might segfault on packet.send_on(crap), but will reduce the performance => have 2 possible calls)
